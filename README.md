# 🌦️ Weather App

A responsive weather application built with **vanilla JavaScript** that displays
real-time weather information for selected cities, with a focus on **clean UI and
practical front-end logic**.

This project was independently designed and implemented as part of my learning
journey and portfolio.

## 🔐 API Keys

This project uses external APIs that require private keys.

For security reasons, API keys are **not included** in this repository.
To run the project locally, replace the placeholder values in the JavaScript files
with your own API keys.

Since this is a client-side application, API keys are still exposed in the browser.
A backend proxy would be required for full security.
