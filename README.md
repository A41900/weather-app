# Weather App

A small responsive weather application built with vanilla JavaScript.
The app displays real-time weather information for selected cities and focuses
on practical front-end logic, such as working with external APIs, handling basic
application state, and managing simple error cases. The interface is intentionally
simple, prioritising clarity over visual experimentation.

## Live Demo

> https://a41900.github.io/weather-app/

This public demo relies on free-tier API services and may be temporarily
unavailable due to rate limits. When this happens, the application can be run
locally using personal API keys.

## API Keys & Security

This project uses external APIs that require private keys.
For security reasons, API keys are not included in this repository and must be
provided locally by replacing the placeholder values in the JavaScript files.

Because this is a purely client-side application, API keys are still exposed in
the browser. A backend proxy would be required to properly protect them in a
production environment.
